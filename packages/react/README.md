# Bun UI Library

Bun UI is a modern, lightweight, and customizable React component library designed to help developers build stunning and accessible user interfaces effortlessly. It provides a collection of reusable, responsive, and fully typed components that integrate seamlessly into your projects.

## ✨ Features

- **Lightweight**: Optimized for performance with minimal overhead.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to your design system.
- **Responsive**: Designed with mobile-first principles.
- **Accessible**: Built with accessibility in mind to ensure inclusivity.
- **TypeScript Support**: Fully typed for a better developer experience.

```

## 📚 Documentation

For detailed documentation and examples, visit the [Bun UI Documentation](https://bun-ui.khanguyen.com).

## 💡 Open Code, Open Source

Bun UI is fully open source and designed with simplicity and developer freedom at its core. Many components are built using [@radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) primitives, providing accessible and high-quality behavior while leaving styling and customization in your hands.

Need a custom version of a component? Simply copy the source from the library into your project directory and tweak it to fit your design or specific use case — no complicated overrides or internal coupling.

I believe great UI libraries should be transparent, flexible, and easy to extend.
