<ComponentPreview name="file-upload-basic" />

## Usage

Import the `FileUpload` component and its subcomponents from `@bun-ui/react`:

```jsx
import { FileUpload, FileUploadDropZone, FileUploadTrigger, FileUploadList } from "@bun-ui/react"
```

The FileUpload component provides two ways to trigger file selection:

1. Using `FileUploadDropZone` for drag and drop functionality:

```jsx
<FileUpload>
  <FileUploadDropZone>
    <p>Drag and drop files here, or click to select files</p>
  </FileUploadDropZone>
  <FileUploadList/>
</FileUpload>
```

2. Using `FileUploadTrigger` for a simple button trigger:

```jsx
<FileUpload>
  <FileUploadTrigger>Select Files</FileUploadTrigger>
  <FileUploadList/>
</FileUpload>
```
